# Covid_policy_response_abm

This repository is for the publication 

Oswald, Malleson, Suchak (2023). An agent-based model of the 2020 international policy 
diffusion in response to the COVID-19 pandemic with particle filter. (in preparation)

To reproduce the full body of work, take the following steps:

1. Run the jupyter "notebook run_base_model_and_filter_with_plotting_jupyter.ipynb"
   This reproduces a substantial amount of the above paper including Figure 2, 4 and 5.
   To reproduce Figure 4 exactly, the notebook has to take the parameter no_of_iterations equal to 100.
   To reproduce Figure 5 exactly, the notebeook has to take the parameter n_of_iterations equal to 1000.
   
2. To reproduce Figure 6 in full several intermediary steps are necessary: 
    
    2.1
    
    2.2
    
    2.3 
    
    2.4
    
3. To reproduce Figure 7 run the script "experiment_da_window_size.py".
